# BTR.jl
Estimate Bayesian Topic Regression models

## Importing necessary functions

In order to estimate BTR models and plot their output, you will first need to import the necessary functions. First, make sure you are in the correct working directory (i.e. the one which contains the src folder). Then run the line
```julia
include("src/BTR.jl")
```
which will load both the estimation and visualisation functions into your workspace.
